# Middleman Ruby Script

This simple Ruby script acts as a middleman between a process and the user, allowing you to send and receive input to and from the processm, the awesome part is that it automatically does a hot reload whenever a file is changed.

I made this ('made' hah, I prompted chatGPT rather) wanting to use visual studio code for flutter development with react natives hot reload functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 2.5 or above)
- Gems: listen, open3

## Installation

1. Clone or download this script.

2. Place the script inside the root of your flutter project.

3. Run 'ruby middleman.rb'

If there are any bugs please let me know.
