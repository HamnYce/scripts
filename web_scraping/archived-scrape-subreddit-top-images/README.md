# Project Archived

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the [Reddit OAuth2 Wiki](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2) for providing valuable information and guidance during the creation of this project.

## Overview

This project, `scrape-subreddit-top-images`, has been archived and is no longer maintained. The scripts were designed to scrape top images from specified subreddits using Reddit's API.

## Reason for Archival

Due to changes in Reddit's API policies and the deprecation of certain endpoints, the functionality of this project has been compromised. As a result, the scripts may no longer work as intended.

## Components

- **ImageScraper**: Scrapes image links from JSON files and downloads them.
- **JsonScraper**: Fetches subreddit JSON data based on a query term.
- **Main**: Orchestrates the scraping process by taking user input and invoking the scrapers.
- **RedditParty**: Handles API requests to Reddit.

## Future Use

While this project is no longer functional, the code may still serve as a reference for similar scraping tasks or for educational purposes.

Thank you for your understanding.
